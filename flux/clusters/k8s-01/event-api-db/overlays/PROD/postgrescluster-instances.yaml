# 2024-11-04: Switchover to hwn02 as a part of moving from legacy unnamed instances (#19803)

# https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/tutorials/cluster-management/administrative-tasks#targeting-an-instance
# 1. Requires fully-qualified instance id of new master
# 2. New master must be in sink with current master (check via `patronictl list`)
# 3. Its recommended to retain switchover section, to keep track of last desired master both in code and k8s
